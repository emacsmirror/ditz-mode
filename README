About Ditz and Ditz mode
========================

Ditz_ is a distributed issue tracking system, written in Ruby by William
Morgan, and designed for use with distributed version control systems such
as Mercurial_.  Ditz mode is an editing mode for GNU Emacs_, allowing Ditz
commands to be run directly inside an Emacs buffer.  You can find the
latest version of Ditz mode at Bitbucket_.

Ditz mode is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your option)
any later version.  See the file ``COPYING`` for details.

Setting things up
=================

Put ``ditz-mode.el`` in your lisp load path and something like the
following in your ``.emacs`` file::

    (require 'ditz-mode)
    (define-key global-map "\C-c\C-d" 'ditz-todo)

Other contributed stuff
=======================

The ``contrib`` directory contains other Ditz-related files you may be
interested in:

``ditz-tag.patch``
    A patch for Ditz which adds indicators to each issue, showing whether
    it's a feature or a bug.  Ditz mode highlights these specially, if
    they're found.

``hg.rb``
    A Ditz hook to automatically update Mercurial_ status when issues are
    added or removed.  It can easily be customized to support other DVCSes
    (e.g., **git** or **bzr**).
